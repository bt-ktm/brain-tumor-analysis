# Brain Tumor Classification

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Developed SVM and logistic regression models to classify MRI brain scans as tumor or non-tumor based on statistical and textural features, within AI4All's Ignite accelerator. We used data cleaning and analysis skills as well as various Python libraries to prepare our data and write code.


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Brain tumors can be one of the deadliest diseases, and early identification and treatment are critical to optimize outcomes. Not only is correct identification critical, but it is also highly difficult to the complex and diverse nature of brain tumors. By automating the process of identification, we can potentially speed up the process of diagnosis and increase the likelihood that the correct treatment will be administered, improving patient outcomes.

### Data Cleaning and SMOTE
We first cleaned our dataset, removing all null and duplicated values. We also used StandardScaler to regularize the features. Our dataset was imbalanced, with 92.82% of the data being tumor-positive. We applied SMOTE to create a balanced dataset. We used two different models: Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We used an 80-20 train-test split for both:

### Logistic Regression

### SVMs and k-fold Cross Validation
We used 5-fold cross validation, and set C=10. This meant that any mistakes would be highly penalized, resulting in a narrower margin and decision boundary.
